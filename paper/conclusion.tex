\section{Conclusion}

This paper presents the design and implementation of a distributed broker that implements continuous query-based syndication over richly-defined streams.
The CQBS broker, which is implemented in Go, offers more expressive power while remaining tractable to implement on embedded, constrained clients typical of the Internet of Things.
CQBS strikes a middle ground between the fast but restricted descriptive power of topic-based pubsub systems and the rich descriptive power but heavyweight nature of content-based pubsub.
Above this, we demonstrate how the system can be made highly available using a logically-centralized replicated coordinator to maintain consistency between distributed brokers.
