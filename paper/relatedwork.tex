%TODO: do we define/justify the basic principles of pubsub anywhere here, e.g. decoupling between publishers and subscribers?

The CQBS distributed broker is most closely related to \emph{publish-subscribe} systems, but because of its intended use in building dynamic applications for the so-called ``Internet of Things'', we also draw comparisons between it and several IoT application frameworks. We examine each of the systems below along the primary design dimensions of the CQBS broker: richness of publisher descriptions, expressiveness of syndication model, client complexity and fault tolerance.

\subsection{Topic-Based Publish-Subscribe}

Most publish-subscribe (``pub-sub'')systems fall into one of two categories: topic-based and content based \cite{eugster2003many}. The most basic form of topic-based pub-sub is a channel model, in which producers (data publishers) transmit data associated with some channel name to a broker.

%While our CQBS system is primarily a \emph{publish-subscribe} solution, its goals of providing 
%resource discovery as well as data transfer means that we must also
